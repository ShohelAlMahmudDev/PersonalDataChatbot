## Overview
RAGBot brings together modern frontend and backend technologies to deliver a seamless, engaging chatbot experience. With a user-friendly interface built using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and a powerful backend powered by FastAPI and a suite of AI libraries, RAGBot is designed for anyone looking to get technical advice or career insights from a Software Engineer’s perspective.

## Features
- **Personalized Responses:** Tailors answers based on the user’s profile data.
- **Advanced Query Processing:** Uses state-of-the-art retrieval and generation techniques.
- **Technical Guidance:** Acts as a virtual Software Engineer to answer coding and career-related questions.
- **Responsive Frontend:** Developed with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a modern UI.
- **Robust Backend:** Powered by FastAPI, Uvicorn, and AI libraries such as Sentence Transformers, FAISS, LangChain, and pypdf.
- **Easy Configuration:** Environment-specific settings are managed through dotenv.

## Architecture
RAGBot is structured into two primary layers:

### Frontend
- **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
- **Role:** Provides a responsive and interactive interface for users to enter their profile data and queries.

### Backend
- **Framework:** FastAPI (with Uvicorn as the ASGI server).
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - **Sentence Transformers & FAISS:** For generating text embeddings and efficient similarity searches.
  - **LangChain:** To orchestrate the flow of data and model interactions.
  - **pypdf:** For processing PDF documents when needed.
  - **dotenv:** For managing environment variables and configuration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Git** (for repository cloning)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine via:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShohelAlMahmudDev/RAGBot.git
cd RAGBot
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies
Install the required dependencies. Ensure you have a virtual environment activated, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*If you need to create the `requirements.txt`, include the following packages:*
```
fastapi
uvicorn
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu
pypdf
langchain
python-dotenv
```

### Frontend Setup
The frontend is built from static files. These can be served either by your Python backend or any web server. No additional build steps are needed.

## Configuration
RAGBot uses environment variables to manage API keys, model configurations, and paths to profile data. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with settings similar to:
```
# Example .env file
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MODEL_CONFIG=path/to/your/model/config.json
PROFILE_DATA_PATH=path/to/your/profile_data.json
```
*Adjust these values to match your own configuration and deployment environment.*

## Usage

### Running the Backend Server
Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn. The following command assumes that your FastAPI app is located in `app/main.py` with an app instance named `app`:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
This command runs the server in development mode with automatic code reloading.

### Interacting with RAGBot
- **Access the Frontend:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate URL if hosted differently) to interact with the chatbot.
- **API Documentation:** Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` to explore the interactive API documentation provided by FastAPI.

Once launched, input your profile data and ask your questions. RAGBot will process the input using its retrieval-augmented generation engine and return a personalized response.
